## gapFinisher - A reliable gap filling pipeline for SSPACE-LongRead scaffolder output

-------------------------------

PREREQUISITE: A successful run of SSPACE-LongRead so that the directory "inner-scaffold-sequences" is created.

a. Installation
---------------

Get and install MATLAB Compiler runtime (MCR) from:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/fgap/files/MCR_LINUX64b.tar.gz

Follow the MCR installation instructions at:

https://github.com/pirovc/fgap

at chapters

"Download MCR" and "Install MCR".

FGAP itself is provided with the gapFinisher download so that does not need to be installed.

In your preferred installation directory (e.g. /usr/bin/ ; /home/user/bin/ ):

<pre>
cd gapFinisher
chmod -R 775 *
</pre>

NOTE: sudo the chmod if needed


b. Running gapFinisher
----------------------

After steps in a.

~~~
./gapFinisher -i <PATH_TO_SSPACE_LONGREAD_OUTPUT_FOLDER> -l <PATH_TO_LONG_READS_FASTA_USED_WITH_SSPACE> -m <MCR_LOCATION> -t <NUM_THREADS>
~~~

Example:

~~~
./gapFinisher -i /home/kammoji/test/scaffolding/PacBio_scaffolder_results -l /home/kammoji/test/filtered_subreads.60X.fasta -m /home/kammoji/bin/MCR_LINUX64b/v717 -t 1
#NOTE: -t needs to be specified always! The current version of gapFinisher does not have a default set.
